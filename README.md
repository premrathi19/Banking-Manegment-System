# Banking-Manegment-System
The Problem :

Customer experience is an integral part of a bank’s operations. That’s why banks focus a lot on improving customer experience by removing hassles and enhancing the facilities they provide. Opening a new account in a bank usually requires a person to visit the bank, fill out a form, and submit the necessary papers. All of these tasks take up a lot of time and dampen the overall customer experience. Moreover, many people have to take time out of their schedules to go to a bank.

The Solution:

You can solve this problem by creating a software solution where people can sign up and open a new account in a bank digitally. This way, the person wouldn’t have to visit the bank physically and thus, would save a lot of time and effort. The banking management system can also allow the user to make transactions, deposit and withdraw funds, and check the account balance. 

Here’s source code for a banking project in Python. The following program has these features:

•	It allows users to open new accounts
•	Users can make transactions by entering the respective amounts
•	Users can check the balance of their accounts
•	Admin can view a list of users to see how many users there are along with their details
